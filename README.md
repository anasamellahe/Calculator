# OdinCalc

## Introduction
OdinCalc is a simple on-screen calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Displays user input and results dynamically.
- Includes an "AC" button to clear all input.
- Handles decimal numbers correctly.
- Prevents division by zero errors.
- Styled with a modern and minimalistic design.

## How It Works
1. Users can click on numeric buttons to input numbers.
2. Clicking an operator button stores the current number and operation.
3. Pressing "=" computes the result and updates the display.
4. The "AC" button clears all input and resets the calculator.
5. The calculator prevents multiple operators from being entered consecutively.

## Extra Features (Planned Enhancements)
- Add keyboard support for better usability.
- Implement a backspace button for corrections.
- Improve decimal point handling.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the calculator.
